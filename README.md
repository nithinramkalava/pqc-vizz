## 📖 About

This application was developed as a major project for a BTech Computer Science degree at Vasireddy Venkatadri Institute of Technology, India. It aims to help developers understand and visualize post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to prepare for the quantum computing era.

### Features

- Interactive visualizations of all three NIST standardized post-quantum algorithms
- Performance benchmarks and comparison
- Educational content explaining algorithm functionality
- Code examples and implementation details

## 📦 NPM Package

The core cryptographic implementations are available as an NPM package:

- **Package:** [pqc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pqc)
- **Implementation:** Pure JavaScript with no native dependencies
- **Algorithms:** ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA

### Performance

| Algorithm | Operation | Performance |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| ML-KEM-768 | Key Generation | 2,305 op/s |
| ML-DSA65 | Sign | 120 op/s |
| SLH-DSA-SHA2-128f | Sign | 90ms |

## 🧪 Research Paper

This project is accompanied by a research paper titled "Post-Quantum Security for Web Applications" that details the implementation approach and performance benchmarks.

## 💻 Technologies
